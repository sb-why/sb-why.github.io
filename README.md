## Human Computer Interactions Portfolio

### About Me

My name is Shreeja Bhattacharjee. I am a senior studying Industrial Engineering and Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. My non-related work passions include bubble tea and wasting time watching TV shows. 

This website is my portfolio for my Human Computer Interactions class. I go over projects I completed in this class, while briefly mentioning my design methodology
