This was my first project, and the only project to be completed individually. I was tasked with the job of finding an example of good design and bad design from WPIs various webpages, as well as defending my choice. I found out two things during this assignment: 
1) I was impressed with my ability to utilize design rules to identify areas of improvements.
2) Finding examples of good design is exceedingly more difficult than finding examples of bad design, especially when viewed under the lens of scrutiny.

### Design for Others

In this project, the goal was to redesign a website for mobile use. Our team of 4 used Adobe XD to redesign the arrangement and look of the website technocopia.org. Using basic design principles, we simplified the entire website and made it easier to navigate. Through various rounds of user testing, we were able to identify weaknesses in our design and improve upon on them.

### Design for Understanding

Here, the aim was to present a data set in a clear but simple manner. Our team picked the dataset related to the famous TV show The Bacholorette. We presented the data with two different angles- one unbiased, and another with the intent to convey a narrative. We started off with paper sketches and ended with proper graphical represntations in Vega-Lite.

### Design for Tension

This project resulted in the creation of a ChatBot. Our ChatBot aimed to inform, and hopefully persuade, on the controversial topic of Vaccines. Using FlowXO, we wrote our scripts for the ChatBot based upon the user's stance on Vaccines, as well as possible reasons for why they were using this ChatBot. Finally, we focused on making the ChatBot conversational, so that interacting with it would be like talking to a person.

### Design for Well-Being
<img src = "/surprise.png">
Design for Well-Being presented an unique challenge of trying to use technology to help our mental health. Specifically, we were tasked with using Affectiva, a set of libraries that determines users emotions based on visual input from a webcam, to create a website that "promoted well-being." Our website used a combination of making the user aware of their emotions and music to hopefully steer them towards more positive emotions.

### Design for Another World
<img src = "/horror.PNG">
Our final project, this one involved virtual reality. We were to design an "alteranate world" with a goal in mind. The team decided our goal was to "Design for Horror." Our virtual reality took place in a haunted museum. Horrifying blood and graphics, coupled with the Slenderman sountrack, resulted in a very eerie and unsettling virtual reality.
