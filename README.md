This was my first project, and the only project to be completed individually. I was tasked with the job of finding an example of good design and bad design from WPIs various webpages, as well as defending my choice.

### Design for Well-Being
Design for Well-Being presented an unique challenge of trying to use technology to help our mental healthy. Specifically, we were tasked with using Affectiva, a set of libraries that determines users emotions based on visual input from a webcam, to create a website that "promoted well-being."

### Design for Another World
Our final project, this one involved virtual reality. We were to design an "alteranate world" with a goal in mind. The team decided to "Design for Horror," and our virtual reality took place in a haunted museum. Ths was one of my favorite projects as it was a lot of fun.
