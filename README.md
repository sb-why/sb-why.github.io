This was my first project, and the only project to be completed individually. I was tasked with the job of finding an example of good design and bad design from WPIs various webpages, as well as defending my choice. I found out two things during this assignment: 1) I was impressed with my ability to utilize design rules to identify areas of improvements 2) Finding examples of good design seems exceedingly more difficult, when viewed under the lens of scrutiny.

### Design for Well-Being
Design for Well-Being presented an unique challenge of trying to use technology to help our mental healthy. Specifically, we were tasked with using Affectiva, a set of libraries that determines users emotions based on visual input from a webcam, to create a website that "promoted well-being."

Our final project, this one involved virtual reality. We were to design an "alteranate world" with a goal in mind. The team decided to "Design for Horror," and our virtual reality took place in a haunted museum. Ths was one of my favorite projects as it was a lot of fun.
