### Design for Others
In this project, the goal was to redesign a website for mobile use. Our team of 4 used Adobe XD to redesign the look of the website technocopia.org.

### Design for Understanding
Here, the aim was to present data in a clear but simple manner. Our team picked the topic of Bacholorette. We presented the data with two different angles- one unbiased, and another with the intent to convey a narrative.

This project resulted in the creation of a ChatBot. Our ChatBot aimed to inform, and hopefully persuade, on the controversial topic of Vaccines.

### Design for Well-Being
Design for Well-Being presented an unique challenge of trying to use technology to help our mental healthy. Specifically, we were tasked with using Affectiva, a set of libraries that determines users emotions based on visual input from a webcam, to create a website that "promoted well-being."

### Design for Another World
Our final project, this one involved virtual reality. We were to design an "alteranate world" with a goal in mind. The team decided to "Design for Horror," and our virtual reality took place in a haunted museum. Ths was one of my favorite projects as it was a lot of fun.
